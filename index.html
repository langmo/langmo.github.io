			The decision between mesoderm and endoderm cell fate in zebrafish gastrulation is based on the interconnection of a kinetic proofreading mechanism measuring cell-cell contact durations, and a positive feedback loop.

	<p>
		Single cellular organisms as well as individual cells of a multicellular organism constantly observe the current state of their environment to dynamically adapt their behavior and fate decisions. 
		However, the necessary information for the corresponding molecular adaptation mechanisms is not always readily available for measurement. 
		Furthermore, the adaptation mechanism itself might operate on a similar or even a slower timescale than the one determining the change of environmental conditions, such that the environment might already have completely changed before adaptation can be accomplished.
		In such cases, cells can utilize regularities in environmental dynamics to estimate the future environmental conditions based on their past dynamics, and then directly adapt to those estimated future conditions.

			Different modeling frameworks and their relationships: A) ODEs; B-D) block-oriented nonlinear systems; E) species-reaction graph; and F) species-graph.

	<p>
		My work spans different modeling frameworks, including ordinary differential equations (ODE), stochastic models, graphs and block-oriented nonlinear systems. I dynamically iterate between these different representations of the same system, following the logic that the problem at hand dictates the right framework, that no framework is suited for all problems, and that the most progress can be expected in the interface between different frameworks.

		Recently, I got interested in the Abelian sandpile, and especially in its harmonic dynamics induced by harmonic fields of different orders. In a publication currently available as a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10823" target="_blank">pre-print</a>, we not only showed that these dynamics exists and demonstrated how to induce them, we also proved that the set of all harmonic fields provide universal coordinates for the sandpile group, allowing to map sandpile configurations between different domains.
